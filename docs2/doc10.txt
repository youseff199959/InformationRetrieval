The evaluation of an information retrieval system' 
is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users.
 In general, measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query.
 Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for Boolean retrieval[clarification needed] or top-k retrieval,
 include precision and recall. All measures assume a ground truth notion of relevancy:
 every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice,
 queries may be ill-posed and there may be different shades of relevancy.
